# Welcome to CovidTrack

Using a voice assistant and predictive algorithms, we can help reduce the overhead on hospitals and give good orientation for people who are not feeling well. The patients access the June Tracker for answering a questionnaire. Our artificial intelligence system categorizes patients by severity level and advises them on the need to urgently go to the hospital, stay home, telehealth uses and monitoring the symptomâ€™s evolution. These data are associated with public information to reduce people's agglomeration, risks of contamination in hospitals, prioritizing patients by risk level, identifying clusters, and give statistics about Covid19 cases, and hospital capacity.
